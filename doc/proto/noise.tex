\section{Noise}

purpose of ...

There are many situations in which an EOFi sends out data to the network,
although you did not write a message: In fact, as EOFi \textbf{always}
sends packets in a fixed interval, it needs to have data to encrypt and send.

Noise can be any type of random data. As the current random number generators
are quite expensive, it is recommend to use a huge dictionary, old 
messages, logfiles, public emails, etc. for noise input.
