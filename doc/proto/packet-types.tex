\label{eofpkg}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Introduction}
No packet (including everything) may exceed the size of \emph{EOF\_L\_PKG\_MAX}.

EOF knows about
\begin{itemize}
\item commands: internal plaintext packets.
\item onions: multiple times encrypted packets including routing information
\item postcards: packets containing transport protocol dependent header
\end{itemize}
Commands are the innermost packet type and only seen within EOFi and EOFs.
Commands are then bundled into a multi layer onion. Each layer contains
commands after decryption.
Onions are put onto a postcard afterwards and are sent out on the network.
\textbf{Only encrypted packets are sent out on the network.}

\subsection{Commands}
Command packets are used for the communication inside of EOFi and EOFs and
are described in detail in the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item eofi2tp, \ref{eofi2tp}, page \pageref{eofi2tp}
\item eofi2ui, \ref{eofi2ui}, page \pageref{eofi2ui}
\item eofi2crypto, \ref{eofi2crypto}, page \pageref{eofi2crypto}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Onions}
Onions are sent out on the network and are multiple times encrypted.
They are building the base for the EOF protocol.
Onions are described in detail in chapter \ref{onions}, page \pageref{onions}.
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Postcards}
Onions are afterwards encapsulated into the transport protocol specific
packet type and sent out onto the network.
Postcards are described in detail in chapter \ref{postcards}, page \pageref{postcards}.
