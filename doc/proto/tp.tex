\section{Transport Protocols}
This chat protocol does not rely on a specific underlying transport protocol,
but is \textit{transport protocol independent}. 
Transport protocols are used to submit an onion to the next peer.

\subsection{Network packets ("`postcards"')}
\label{eofpostcard}
%Onions are encapsulated into the transport protocol specific
%packet type and sent out onto the network.
%The term Postcards are described in detail in chapter \ref{postcards}, page \pageref{postcards}.
A postcard "`packet"' contains one onion packet plus the transport protocol
shell. Postcard packets are the only packet type that is seen by a possible
attacker ("`on the wire"'). 
The name postcard was choosen to reflect the fact, that anyone
passing the postcard can read what is written on it.
