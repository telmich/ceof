\section{Onion Routing}
\label{onionrouting}
Onion routing is used to ensure sender-receiver anonymity. In contrast
to the Tor-network, there are no exit nodes and the receiver can be anyone
in the onion chain (see fig. \ref{onionrouting}).

\subsection{Variable Peers}
Different routes for every packet

\subsection{Source based routing}
Either here or in Intra Machine Intra Client
\subsection{Peer selection}
Which peers, how many. Constant? May give upper bounds of latency.

8 * 0.5seconds = 4 seconds delay.

\subsection{Packet sizes}
The average packet size depending on the number of peers it was
(re-)encrypted for can be found in table \ref{pkgsizes}.
It was generated by running the reference implementation
(\verb=ceof onion -m "test" peer0  | wc -c=)
and increasing the number of proxy peers to be inserted.
The resulting size includes only the final onion,
but does not include transport protocol headers.
