All client-to-server IRC protocols in use today are descended from the protocol implemented in the irc2.4.0 version of the IRC2 server, and documented in RFC 1459. Since RFC 1459 was published, the new features in the irc2.10 implementation led to the publication of several revised protocol documents (RFC 2810, RFC 2811, RFC 2812 and RFC 2813); however, these protocol changes have not been widely adopted among other implementations.\ref{irc-wp}

Since 1989 deleoped\ref{rfc2810},
first formally documented in May 1993 by RFC 1459\ref{rfc1459}.

A typical setup involves a single process (the server) forming a
      central point for clients (or other servers) to connect to,
      
   This distributed model, which requires each server to have a copy
   of the global state information, is still the most flagrant problem
   of the protocol as it is a serious handicap, which limits the maximum
   size a network can reach.  If the existing networks have been able to
   keep growing at an incredible pace, we must thank hardware
   manufacturers for giving us ever more powerful systems.

The server forms the backbone of IRC as it is the only component
   of the protocol which is able to link all the other components
   together:


   The only network configuration allowed for IRC servers is that of
   a spanning tree where each server acts as a central node for the rest
   of the network it sees.

   Servers: A, B, C, D, E         Clients: 1, 2, 3, 4

                    [ Fig. 1. Sample small IRC network ]


   The IRC protocol provides no mean for two clients to directly
   communicate.  All communication between clients is relayed by the
   server(s).
