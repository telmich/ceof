% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the previous analysis of chat systems and related communication protocols,
several drawbacks can be seen. Most systems suffer a single point of failure,
which is due to the central architecture. Further the message content is often
neither protected nor verified.

The following security features are derived from the weaknesses of the previously
analysed systems as well from the thesis objectives.
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Anonymity}
One of the main objectives of this thesis is to provide a chat system that
hides who is talking to whom. If an attacker controls all hosts that are
part of the chat network, it is impossible to guarantee anonymity.

Thus the implementation should support be resistent against a high percentage
of attacker nodes in the network.
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Sender to receiver anonymity}
Providing anonymity of two people talking to each other is \textbf{not} 
required due to the objectives of this thesis.

\subsection{Receiver identification}
The receiver should be able to verify the identity of the sender, so she
can be sure that the message originated from the correct person.

\section{Confidentiality}
The content of the conversations should be hidden from eavesdropper.
Being able to read the content of messages may also reveal the identity
of the chat partners and thus the anonymity would vanish.

% FIXME: solution:
% We encrypt every message via public-key cryptography\cite{pgp-1},
% so that only the receiver can decrypt and view the message content.
% 
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Integrity}
As messages may contain important content, it is necessary that the integrity
is guaranteed.
% Nico: 1 => reformulate
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Availability}
Most traditional systems rely on central infrastructure to operate, in which a
single party (like the operator) can disable the service. 
No service can be run reliable, if an attacker with infinite resources is assumed.
Thus the requirement for this chat system is to survive the attack of a single
party and to continue delivering the chat service.

%\section{Non security related features}
%To be able to be compete with other chat protocols, \emph{direct} 
%and \emph{group chat} should be supported.
%\subsection{Direct chat
%implemented by two different chat destinations:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \emph{Peers}
%\item \emph{Groups of peers}
%\end{enumerate}
%A peer is just another person (direct chat), a group of peers is the EOF
%equivalent of the IRC channel\cite{irc-1}. As there is no central server,
%groups of peers are managed by each client, and thus the compositions of
%group members may be different on different peers.
%-- 
%Additionally, for practical reasons, EOF must support the following
%chat features:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Direct chat ("`message is only seen by one person"')
%\item Group chat ("`message is sent to specific group, which may consist of
%more than one person"')
%\end{enumerate}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) know(s) \emph{that} you wrote a message.
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) can view the \emph{message content}.
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) can \emph{verify} the source of the message being you.
\item Nobody, but the intended receiver(s) know(s) \emph{who} the message was sent to.
\item The network must survive attacks of a single attacker.
%\item Hard (if not practilcally impossible) to block chatting.
\end{enumerate}
