Ausgangslage

    Currently a lot of chat systems are available, but none of these
    systems implements an anonymous, decentralised and secure architecture.

    Anonymity is important, when people need to hide to whom they are talking to.
    This is for instance true in extreme situations, when reporters located in 
    dangerous areas, submit their messages in danger of life threats, but also 
    applies to a lot of daily situations like sending confidential messages
    in untrusted networks: The basic knowledge of who is talking to whom may cause
    unwanted actions, for instance in politics or at work, when being contacted
    by a head hunter.

    A decentralised architecture helps to avoid easy disruption by eliminating
    the single point of failure. This supports the ability to continue
    communications even under attack from an enemy. This is a general
    requirement for reliable communications, but is necessary e.g. for military
    in case of war, as well as for reporters.

    Secure chat provides the ability to hide message content from eavesdroppers,
    as well as to ensure message and sender authenticity.
    Without this technique an attacker could use the information for harmful
    operations or change the content of the messages. This thread is
    very dangerous i.e. in stock market situations, as well in the previously
    described situations.

    The client, Thomas Gresch from local.ch, is running Skype for internal core
    communications. Skype is a closed source, encrypted, proprietary chat system
    owned by Microsoft. Because of the importance of the internal communications
    and the intensive efforts from Skype to hide how it is working, the research
    for an open alternative that may succeed the use of Skype is supported by
    local.ch.

    The client expects an open documentation about an reliable, secure chat
    system, which could be used to implement an alternative to Skype.
    In return the client supports the research of decentralised 
    and anonymous chat systems.
    

Ziele der Arbeit

    The objective of this thesis is the design and development of a secure,
    decentralised chat system. The main focus is on defining and documenting
    the mode of operation and the protocol definition. Additionally a prototype
    should be implemented. All parts should be based on a detailled analysis of 
    current chat systems. The analysis should not only consider chat 
    systems, but related secure and anonymous communication systems as well.


Aufgaben

    1. Detailed analysis and comparision of legacy chat systems
        to summarise current chat system features and their 
        security characteristics.
    2. Analysse feature and security requirements
    3. Analysis of related communication protocols
    4. Development of a new chat protocol
    5. Development of chat prototype using the new chat protocol
    6. Preparation of a live demonstration of the prototype


Resultate
5. Erwartete Resultate:
5.2 Protocol definition Paper ist noch zu generisch :-)


    1. Report and comparision of current chat systems including strength and weaknesses
    2. Requirement analysis
    3. Report of related communication protocols including strength and weaknesses
    4. Protocol definition paper (containing chat features,
        data types, transport methods, security measures)
    5. Implementation of a prototype for the new chat system
    6. Presentation of a successful anonymous, decentralised chat session, which
       includes proof of the required security by using example attacks.
