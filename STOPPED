- send and receive packet
    - test nodes listen on their listeners
        - create first listener +  create first sender
            ! implement tcp tp

    - test nodes act on EOF messages (forward, drop)

    - listener address != handler address:
        tcp://0.0.0.0:5352 => 0.0.0.0 for listening, 77.109... real address for other peers

    x check all addresses, ensure all peers listen on different ports
    x implement listener first [hack]
